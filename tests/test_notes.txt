[GENERAL TEST STRATEGY]
- Confirm that each IP test produces a clean, readable output.
- Check for correct cleanup: the temp file geo_temp.json should be removed.
- Verify that error messages are descriptive and user-friendly.
- Use both OnlineGDB and local GCC environments for comparison.

[MANUAL TEST IDEAS]
- Run multiple IPs sequentially to confirm consistent behavior.
- Temporarily disconnect from the internet to simulate network failure.
- Make geo_temp.json read-only to trigger file access error.
- Add debug print statements in GeoLocator.c to trace behavior.

[LOG FILE REVIEW]
- All results from automated tests are saved in ./tests/results/.
- Each log file name corresponds to the IP address tested.
- Review logs for formatting consistency (aligned labels, spacing, etc.).

[TROUBLESHOOTING]
- “Error: Failed to retrieve data.” → Internet connection or curl issue.
- “Error: Could not open response file.” → File permission or directory issue.
- “Error: No valid data returned.” → Invalid IP or API response error.
